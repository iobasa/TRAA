      <h2>
      This is what sets the TRAA apart from other clubs and organizations. You'll find us right in the water clearing obstructions from streams, measuring returning salmonids & taking scale samples for DNA analysis, education through trout hatchery tours & stream walks, being a voice for the Thames River watershed & its inhabitants and the list goes on.

        <h3>Trout Hatchery</h3>
        <div id="border1"></div>
        <img src="images/California_Tray_System.jpg" alt="tray system picture">
        <p>The TRAA Trout Hatchery began in the mid-1980's as an outdoor upwelling box located adjacent to Komoka Creek on private property. While it was a simple and rustic affair, the TRAA enjoyed incredible egg hatching and fry survivability rates for several seasons.<br><br>
        While this setup served us well it was also very challenging to maintain. We had to pack the upwelling box with straw bales (see picture above right) to keep the water in the cells from freezing. Members of the Trout Hatchery Rotation had to huddle over each cell picking eggs in wind-driven rain, sleet and snow. Something had to be done so a new setup was housed in a new enclosure.<br><br>
        This facility consisted of a hatching trough with trays, a stainless steel fry box and a 6-foot diameter growth tank.<br><br>
        Always looking to improve, the TRAA Tout Committee began looking at ways to emulate the success we had with the upwelling box when it was outside. To that end we had a new one constructed by the carpentry class at H.B. Beal Secondary School and they did a great job!</p>

      <h3>Salmonid Monitoring Spring 2012</h3>
      <div id="border"></div>
      <p>Here's an overview of what happened over a few weekends in the
      Spring of 2012 when TRAA members and personnel from the Upper
      Thames River Conservation Authority (UTRCA) waded in for Year 3
      of our 5-year Salmonid Tagging and Monitoring Program.
      <br><br>
      Jon George, an MNR biologist from Thunder Bay
      who is helping us out with this project, compiled
      the comparative results of 2010 (Year 1) and
      2011 (Year 2) and 2012 (Year 3) in an easy-to-understand report. </p>

      <h3>Stream Rehabilitation</h3>
      <div id="border"></div>
      <p>The TRAA trout hatchery is fun and educational but the TRAA is not about stocking fish for a "put & take" style of fishery.<br><br>
      We understand the connection between a healthy aquatic ecosystem and the sustainability of a naturally reproducing fish population, regardless of the species.<br><br>
      The work parties and the work involved at each event vary greatly. Some are very technical, some are just hard slugging and others are a good blend of both.<br><br>
      There are lots of different jobs at each event requiring an array of strengths and capabilities. In other words, everyone is welcome to join in on the fun; whether your young or old, a lightweight or a bull, everyone has a place and a job at a TRAA stream rehabilitation work party! </p>

      <h3>Walleye Hatchery</h3>
      <div id="border"></div>
      <p>The TRAA and the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority (UTRCA), with the blessing of the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), agreed to the operation of a walleye hatchery in Fanshawe Conservation Area, just north-east of London, Ontario. <br><br>While this was a relatively short-lived initiative, it was very popular with members and the community at large. Many would conclude it was also very successful considering the exciting fishery that developed closely thereafter.<br><br>The Lake Erie Management Unit (LEMU) forced the TRAA to shut down the walleye hatchery after only three seasons of operation. The LEMU's decision was dubiously based on an American study, that the Thames River walleye were genetically unique from the Grand River walleye (the TRAA's source for eggs).</p>

      <div id="border"></div>
      <p>The brown trout were transferred from the TRAA hatchery and released at the same site on Medway Creek as in previous years.<br><br>
      TRAA members loaded up the trout fry into the transfer tank at the hatchery site. We then proceeded to the release site north of London, Ontario.<br><br>
      We were met there by two of the landowners through which this section of Medway Creek flows. They also brought out a large contingent of family and friends to lend a helping hand.</p>

      <p>The TRAA be helped out again this year with a cleanup of the shoreline and area of the river near the Komoka Road bridge.<br><Br>
      After meeting at the NEW parking lot for Komoka Provincial Park on Gideon Drive, everyone carpooled to the usual stretch around the bridge.<br><br>
      Thank you to all that showed up to help out!</p>

      <h3>Medway Creek Habitat Project</h3>
      <div id="border"></div>
      <p>Those of you who have been involved with the brown trout releases over the past few years may recognize this spot on Medway Creek as the release point.<br><br>
      Those of you who have been attending the last few General Meetings will also know that this is part of a 280-metre stretch on which we will be focusing future habitat rehabilitation efforts.<br><br>
      We have met with and have the support of the two landowners through which this stretch of Medway Creek flows.</p>

      <p>This was a series of informal, hands-on sessions that resulted in a spinning or fly rod, assembled and finished by those who took part.<br><Br>
      This opportunity was open only to current members of the TRAA, WOFGPA and/or FCFFC.<br><br>
      fly guides"Rod Building - Your First Time" was presented by: Thames River Anglers Association, with support from the Western Ontario Fish & Game Protective Assâ€™n and the Forest City Fly Fishing Club.</p>

      <div id="border"></div>
      <p>A few TRAA members cleared a number of fallen trees and other blockages on October 13th.<br><br>
      Dan Shinkelshoek made a video of the proceedings and it's worth a look so click on the picture to view.<br><br>
